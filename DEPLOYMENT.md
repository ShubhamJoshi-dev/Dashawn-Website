# 🚀 Deployment Guide

## ✅ Build Fixed!

The SSR (Server-Side Rendering) issues have been resolved! Your website now builds successfully for deployment.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

1. **FloatingElements Component**: Added proper client-side checks for `window` object
2. **HeroPhotos Component**: Added `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks
3. **FunnyCaption Component**: Added clipboard API checks for SSR compatibility

## 📦 Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Dashain Fun Gallery"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel:**
